OdinZ80
=======

This is a Z80 assembler suite for Windows and Linux. This project will be three parts: Assembler, Disassembler and Debugger for the Zilog Z80 Microprocessor.
OdinZ80 is a development tool to aid programmers still using the Z80 Microprocessor. There will be two ways to build the software,
first on Windows environments, there will be Batch files and on Linux there will be Bash Scripts.
Just run the build.bat or build.sh files (when they have been created) and the suite will compile.
 Eventually there will be a website were you can download compiled executables from, but for the time being, this is the only location to get the software from.
